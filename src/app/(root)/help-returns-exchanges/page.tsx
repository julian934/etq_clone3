          <h1 className='font-semibold' >Customs, duties and taxes</h1>
          <p>All returns and exchanges sent from countries outside the European Union (with the exception of the United Kingdom) are shipped under the terms of Delivery Duties Unpaid (DDU). 
            This means that customs duties, import taxes, and other applicable charges are not covered or deducted by us.</p>
            <p>If you return an item from a country outside the EU, you agree to pay any applicable customs duties, fees, or taxes imposed by the country of origin or transit.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, we are unable to estimate these costs in advance and cannot reimburse them.
               In many cases, such charges are collected by the carrier or customs authorities when the return is processed. 
               For detailed information about potential additional costs, we recommend contacting your local customs office before sending your return.</p>
